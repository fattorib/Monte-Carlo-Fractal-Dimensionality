# Monte-Carlo Methods for computing the dimension of fractals
The purpose of this project is to explore the method of computing the box-counting dimension of a fractalusing Monte-Carlo random sampling. I chose this project as I have an interest in dynamical systems.  Thetopic of computing fractal dimension using Monte-Carlo methods sounded very interesting to me and I have created my own method/algorithm for estimating the dimension of some fractals.

Full details including Pseudocode and all methods used are included in Overview.pdf.
